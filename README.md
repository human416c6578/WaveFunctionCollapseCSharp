# Wave Function Collapse

This project is inspired by [The Coding Train's Wave Function Collapse video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM) and its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Wave-Function-Collapse).

Tried implementing the Wave Function Collapse algorithm in .NET using async Tasks. It mostly works, but it needs some refactoring and cleanup.
